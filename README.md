For this assignment, I created a GitHub repository and designed a Mortgage Payments class that calculates monthly, semi-monthly, bi-weekly, rapid bi-weekly, weekly, and rapid weekly payment amounts based on user input. I then used Git commands to upload my code to GitHub and shared the link to my repository as part of my submission.
